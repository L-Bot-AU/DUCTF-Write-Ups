## Steps
It was needed to find out what city the person was flying to.
There are two place names mentioned in the transcript SA, and Melbourne.
Melbourne is talked about travelling from the airport, it was determined that it was the correct city.
Next based on the SA I assumed that it might be from Adelaide.
Based on the date the flight was on the 19/09/2021.

From this website I found out that there was a flight from adelaide to melbourne on that date matching approximately the time frame specified in the convo.
I found that the model number of the plane on this website
https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/jq775/
But that was not the correct answer.
Then I saw that the Canberra flight was also an hour.
The same website at flight code va274, got the plane number VH-YIB
