Welcome to the team, glad you chose to join us - hopefully you’ll like it here and want to stay. Let me tell you about your first task:  
  
We’ve observed an underground criminal RaaS operation calling back to this domain, can you find the number of the individual who registered the domain?  
  
Flag format is DUCTF{+61<number>}  
  
# Setup
Domain: 646f776e756e646572.xyz  
  
# Solution
After visiting the domain, on the top right of the website, we see that it was registered with namecheap. If we look up "namecheap whois search" in order to find details about the registrant of the domain, we come up with [this website](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/whois/). After entering "646f776e756e646572.xyz" into the search bar, under "Registrant Phone", we find the phone number to be **Registrant Phone**
