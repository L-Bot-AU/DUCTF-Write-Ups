# Initial thoughts
James: look up images of skyscrapers in Australia, and find something that looks familiar

Ryan: look through major Australian cities in Google Maps satelite 3D view, and find something that looks familiar

After some time, neither option presented anything promising.

# Spamming google searches
We tried searching for unique objects in the image, such as:
 - building with the dome
 - curved glass skyscraper
 - traditional hut on the balcony
 - wavy metal roofing
Tried adding "Australia" at the front of the search, and tried different key words, but no luck.

# ANZ
The brown building had a 3 letter (or 4 letter) abbreviation that seemed like `ANC` or `AVE` or something similar. When I searched `ane building australia`, I realised it was actually saying `ANZ`.

From there is was fairly trivial to work out the apartment location where the photo was taken.

# Finding street name
The required street was not the one directly below the apartment, nor was it one of the neighbouring streets: little_lonsdale_st, lonsdale_st, hardware_st, finlay_alley, queen_st, timothy_ln, heape_st

Turns out it was the street behind the apartment -_-

# Solution
FLAG: `DUCTF{mclean alley}`
