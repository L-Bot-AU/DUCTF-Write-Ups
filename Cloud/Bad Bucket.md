# Challenge
Aw yea have you guys SEEN my new website... its nearly done I swear! I've uploaded it to the ☁️CLOUD☁️ and shared it with you guys now so you can see it! Check it out here

# Setup
Website: [https://storage.googleapis.com/the-bad-bucket-ductf/index.html](https://storage.googleapis.com/the-bad-bucket-ductf/index.html)

# Solution
Navigating up the website path from index.html to the "the-bad-bucket-ductf" part, we see an XML error stating that "This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below."  
  
Looking through the document tree of contents, we see a link to buckets/.notaflag. Navigating [there](https://storage.googleapis.com/the-bad-bucket-ductf/buckets/.notaflag) gives us the flag: DUCTF{if_you_are_beggining_your_cloud_journey_goodluck!}
